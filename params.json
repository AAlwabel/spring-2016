This course will be both theoretical (learning common theoretical models and concepts) and applied (actually fitting said models to data). \r\n\r\n## Required Text\r\n\r\n- None\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources (Textbooks)\r\n\t \r\n- [__Mildred L. Patten__](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Research-Methods-Overview-Essentials/dp/1936523000)<br/>Understanding Research Methods, 8th Ed., February 2012, Pyrczak Publishing:  Glendale, CA.\r\n\r\n## Course Objectives\r\n\r\n- A research methods course is an important foundational course for any graduate program.  \r\n\r\n- The objectives for this course are\r\n \r\n    + To provide an understanding of basic many different research techniques and concepts related to scientific inquiry.  \r\n    + To advance students along the research process by introducing the basic tools needed to critically analyze claims made through written and oral means, and determine the degree to which these claims are valid.  \r\n    + To help students not only in conducting research, but also in judging the validity of any claims made in articles and newspapers, trade journals, academic journals, briefings, presentations, and professional discussions.  \r\n    + To provide a foundation for students in designing and conducting their own research projects and determine how close to the truth they have come in their own efforts \r\n\r\n## Class Content\r\n\r\nClass time will be divided between lectures, discussion, and application of course content.  Lectures will highlight and expand upon points covered in the readings.  The class time should be used by you to ask about concepts that are not entirely clear to you.  Although I will try to get a feel for the students’ understanding of the material, it is always helpful for me to hear it directly from you.  So, please take advantage of class time to ask about the material you don’t understand.  \r\n\r\nHomework\r\n\r\nThere will be homework assignments to ensure students are grasping the material.  Understanding of material is a subjective judgment based on the assignment you turn in to me.  If you show little or no work, or provide little explanation, I have no way of understanding how you arrived at your answer.  Effort is also a subjective judgment based on the professionalism of your work.  I expect that your assignments will be legible, free of misspellings, properly cited, etc.  \r\n\r\nQuizzes\r\n\r\nThere will be multiple pop quizzes throughout the quarter.  The quizzes will be given to determine the extent to which students understand the assigned reading and homework material.  The quizzes will consist of approximately ten questions or problems.  \r\n\r\nExams\r\n\r\nAll exams will be administered in class and will be a closed book format—no reference materials, texts, equation sheets or notes will be allowed during the exams.  \r\n\r\nA.  Mid-term Exam.  This exam will cover material contained in the first half of the quarter.  20-25% of the exam will cover important terms (i.e., vocabulary) that are discussed in the text or in class.  Another 20-25% will be short-answer questions that require the application of terms as given in scenarios.  The remaining 50-60% will require students to solve problems or address research issues.  The expected length of the exam is two hours.\r\n\r\nB.  Final Exam.  The final exam will cover material mainly from the second half of the class and will be similar in format to the midterm exam.  While the final exam is not intended to be comprehensive, some of the material covered in the second half of the class is inextricably linked to the foundational concepts covered in the first half of the class.  Therefore, make sure you understand the foundational concepts well the first time.  The expected length of the exam will be two hours.\r\n\r\nResearch Project\r\nTeam Research Project:  Due 5 Mar.  This assignment requires your team to complete a research\r\nstudy on either job performance or organizational commitment. Teams will use interviews to identify predictors\r\nof one of those two key workplace outcomes, and will collect survey data to test those predictions. The project will be completed in your existing teams and will culminate in a 12- minute presentation near the end of the term. Two in class “help sessions” will be provided during the semester.  More details are provided at the end of this syllabus.\r\n\r\n## Grades\r\n\r\n- You will have four opportunities to demonstrate your level of understanding of the material and ability to apply the concepts to practical problems.  \r\n\r\nGrade Weights\r\n\tWeight\r\nHomework Assignments\t15%\r\nQuizzes\t15%\r\nResearch Project\t20%\r\nMidterm Exam \t25%\r\nFinal Exam\t25%\r\nTotal\t100 %\r\n\r\n## A Few Important Dates\r\n- No Class:   18 January 2016 (Columbus Day), 15 February 2016 (President's Day) \r\n\r\n## Grading\r\n- (1.00 - 0.93]: A\r\n- (0.93 - 0.90]: A-\r\n- (0.90 - 0.87]: B+\r\n- (0.87 - 0.83]: B\r\n- (0.83 - 0.80]: B-\r\n- (0.80 - 0.77]: C\r\n\r\n## Approximate Course schedule (subject to change)\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<thead><tr><th>Day</th><th>Date</th><th>Presenter</th><th>Topic</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>28 March</td><td>Maj Freels</td><td>Course Overview</td><td>None</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>30 March</td><td>Maj Freels</td><td>Course Overview</td><td>None</td></tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\tDate\tTopic\tReadings\tNotes:\r\nT\tJan 6\tSNOW DAY NO CLASS\t\t\r\nTH\tJan 8\tIntroduction, course overview \t\t\r\n T\tJan 13\tIntroduction to research methods;  Philosophy of science; Ethics\tPatten Chp 1-6; \r\nKlein & Zedeck\r\nRosenthal (1994)\t\r\n\r\nTH\tJan 15\tTheory, Hypotheses, Empirical Research Model\tPatten Chp 7-13;\r\nWhetten (1989);\r\nSekaran Ch 5\r\n\t\r\nT\tJan 20\tTechnical Writing\r\nThesis topic development\r\nWorking with the IRB\tBooth Ch 12-14\t\r\nTH\tJan 22\tReviewing Scientific Literature\r\nSampling & power analysis\tBordens Chp 3\r\nPatten Chp 20-26;\r\nCohen (1992)\r\n\t\r\nT\tJan 27\tOperational definitions;\r\nMeasurement & Reliability; Validity\tPatten Chp 27-36;  Patten Chp 43-46\r\n\t\r\nTH\tJan 29\tExperimental Designs; Internal & External Validity\tPatten Chp 37-42;\r\nShadish, Cook, Campbell, Chp 2-3\t\r\nT\tFeb 3\tEffect size; Meta-analysis; Group project work; Test review\tPatten Chp 58-63;\r\n\t\r\nTH\tFeb 5\tFLEX DAY – EXAM PREP\t\t\r\nT\tFeb 10\tMIDTERM EXAM\t\t\r\nTH\tFeb 12\tQualitative Methods\r\nCollecting data\tBaden & Major 2013\r\nCh 20-26\t\r\nT\tFeb 17\tTEST REVIEW\r\nQualitative Methods\r\nWorking with data and findings\r\nAtlasTi\tBaden & Major 2013\r\nCh 27-30\r\nFrazier (2004)\t\r\nTH\tFeb 19\tUnderstanding statistics\r\nSPSS tutorial\r\nt-test\r\nANOVA\r\nRegression\tPatten 49-54\tComputer Lab bldg 640, rm 222\r\nGroups 1, 2, 3 @ 1300\r\nGroups 4 & 5 @ 1400\r\nT\tFeb 24\tModeling and Simulation of Complex Systems\t\tLt Col Oyama\r\nTH\tFeb 26\tModerator/Mediator analysis strategies; Multiple regression; EFA/CFA\tField Pgs 197-209\tComputer Lab bldg 640, rm 222\r\nGroups 1, 2, 3 @ 1300\r\nGroups 4 & 5 @ 1400\r\nT\tMar 3\tGrounded Theory; Delphi Method\t\tDr. Fass\r\nTH\tMar 5\tTest review\r\nGroup project time\tField Chp 17\r\n\t\r\nT\tMar 10\tResearch project presentations\t\t\r\nTH\tMar 12\tFINAL EXAM\t\t\r\n",
